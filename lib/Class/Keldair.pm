## networks
# This is a hash of networks that points to a network object, which contains multifarious info, such as channels, users, the bot's info itself...
# In order to make it an attribute, this is how its done:
# NOTICE --- There is no Network object as of this release.

## command_add(): This is confusing! This must be used to add commands directly.
# Old API: $keldair->command_add(PING => sub { ... });
# New API: $keldair->command_add({ cmd => 'ping', help => 'Check connectivity of bot or user.', code => sub { ... }, ...}[, ...]);
## this method is trained to search for both! It checks the first element to see if it is a HASH. If so, the rest of the elemnts are treated as such. Otherwise, it assumes the rest are using the old API, and there only be two elements (arguments) passed.
