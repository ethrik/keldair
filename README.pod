=head3 STYLE

For those thinking of committing code to Keldair, we have a few, rather basic, requests.
Please DO use proper Perl techniques (3-arg open(), no glob file handles, etc.).
Please DON'T modify the existing code style (Don't run code through `perltidy`, etc.).
Thank you for following our humble requests, happy hacking!
