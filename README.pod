=head2 PREREQUIREMENTS

You need the following module from CPAN: Config::JSON, IO::Socket::IP, IO::Socket::SSL (Only if you want SSL), 
Mouse, Mouse::Meta::Attribute::Custom::Trait::Hash, and Furl (For multiple modules, and keldair-modinstall).

=head3 STYLE

For those thinking of committing code to Keldair, we have a few, rather basic, requests.
Please DO use proper Perl techniques (3-arg open(), no glob file handles, etc.).
Please DON'T modify the existing code style (Don't run code through `perltidy`, etc.).
Thank you for following our humble requests, happy hacking!

=head3 MENTIONS

Thanks to Steve Belcher (sycobuny), for being a MASSIVE help, especially with Timer.pm.
Thanks to Cory Smelosky (gewt), author of b4bot, who we borrowed some module ideas from.
